          "Discovery was a television program geared towards children and teenagers, produced by ABC News. The program began in the fall of 1962 as a weekday series, and was later moved to Sunday mornings. The program was hosted by actor/announcer Frank Buxton and actress/vocalist Virginia Gibson. The show's original studio announcer was ABC staff announcer Bill Owen, who replaced Buxton as host in 1966, continuing through 1971.  The shows hosted by Buxton were mostly studio productions, done in black-and-white;  beginning with Owen, the shows were produced in color, and involved much travel to on-site locations.  The actual on-air title of the series was named according to each year it was produced, beginning with Discovery '62 and ending with Discovery '71 (syndicated reruns only had the title Discovery).\n",
